Dragonfly is my final semester project. It's a mix between 3D Platformer(Spyro) and Action-Adventure(TLoZ). 
I plan to release a few things about my project and hope you enjoy these or give me some advice. 
Actually I plan to release a few lines of code here, I create and use in my game prototype. 
They will be write in C# in the Unity 5 Engine.
